        <h3>
          Overview
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        &nbsp Zacharie comes from the name "Zachariah", a name of Hebrew origin meaning 
        "The Lord recalled". Finley is a surname of Irish, Gaelic, and Scottish 
        origin meaning "Courageous one/Fair Hero". His ethnicity is Norwegian, but 
        he may be mixed because of his father.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        &nbsp His online handle, "mesentericaRobot" is a play on both his major in 
        biology (mycology) and online status. Mesenterica is the species of an 
        edible fungi commonly referred to as "Witches' Butter" (scientific name: 
        Tremella Mesenterica) which is gelatin-like but tough when wet, and also has 
        a saturated yellow-orange color. It could also refer to "Mesenteric", a word 
        that means relating to the mesentery, a membrane that connects the bowel to 
        the back abdominal wall. Robot on the other hand generally refers to a machine
        that automatically carries out actions/commands programmable by a computer. 
        This is actually a reference to the slang term "robot" on 4Chan (an anonymous 
        forum site created in 2003) about a board called "ROBOT9000" (r9k) which is 
        infamous for its controversial topics and socially awkward users/posters 
        commonly referred to as "robots".

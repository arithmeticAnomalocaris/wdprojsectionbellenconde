        <h3>Appearance:</h3>
        <p>
          Zhi-Han dons an indigo-blue <em>yī-fu</em> training uniform, which is
          loose and comfortable enough to move in, and is secured via black
          cuffs around the knees, elbows, and a black belt around the waist. He
          has long white hair that is fixed into twin braids, unnaturally rising
          and bending over his head to resemble the antennas of an insect, more
          specifically, inspired by a mantis. He has a middle-gray skin tone,
          which is common compared to the wide variety that the Eppur tribe has,
          ranging from pure white to pure black.
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>
          He is focused and dedicated, demonstrating a strong work ethic and a
          commitment to getting the job done right. However, this serious
          demeanor shifts when he’s with companions and those he trusts. He
          generally can’t help that he’s a silly man, albeit a proud one at that
          considering his tribe’s high status compared to other fellow
          Discordian tribes. He is a cheery and agreeable man, but he does
          recognize to make guests remember that they are but guests.
        </p>

        <h3>Abilities:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>- Ability to control his interactions with objects (Newton's
          2nd and 3rd Laws of Motion). Manipulating force/acceleration and friction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>

        <h3>History (Backstory)</h3>
        <p>
          There is an alien species referred to as ‘Discordians’, split up into
          multiple tribes. These tribes are very hostile and weary of each
          other, typically reacting with violence and lashing anger towards
          another when done so. As time went on however, this hostility seemed
          to gain some formality, and some tribes began to grow tolerant of each
          other, and became allies to gain better odds against their personal
          enemies. His tribe is respected and looked upon highly for their
          physics-related abilities, as well as their respectable culture,
          however, he finds it difficult to get out of bed in the morning,
          typically slipping on the ground because he forgets to let himself
          feel friction.

        <h3>Trivia:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            - The name “Zhì” (智) by itself means “ambition, wisdom”, and is a fire-elemental name; 
            “Hán” (韓) means “brave, ferocious”, and is a water-elemental name. The name has phonetic 
            similarity to “志涵”, a name that means “ambitious” and “thoughtful”.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            - Discordians format their name as “[tribe name] [given name]”.
          </li><br>
          <li>
           - The braids of his hair are bent like antennas, and they even occasionally 
            twitch when his touch senses are more responsive.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            - His fighting style and appearance is inspired by a real life Chinese fighting 
            style referred to as “Praying Mantis”, which heavily emphasizes close-range 
            fighting, and quick movements and techniques. This is what earns him the 
            nicknames (insults) “Buckle-wrists” from Turn Gregor, and “Lineola” 
            (The scientific name for an African Praying Mantis) from Kitten Gatzo.

            - The braids of his hair are bent like antennas, and they even occasionally

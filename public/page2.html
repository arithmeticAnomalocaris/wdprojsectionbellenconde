        <h3>Appearance:</h3>
        <p>
          Suzanna is a young woman with a slender build and pale complexion. She
          has wine-red eyes, long eyelashes, and straight, dark brown hair,
          which she ties up in a neat bun, save for loose strands on the side of
          her face. She has straight, square bangs, which are parted slightly in
          the middle and cover her eyebrows. Suzanna dresses in a white, low-cut
          evening gown with short sleeves and long, white gloves, and a bustle
          train at the back. On her head, she wears 3 feathers, with a white
          veil attached that goes below her waistline.
        </p>

        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>
          Suzanna is a calm woman, with a friendly demeanor and gentle smile
          always appearing on her delicate countenance, genteel expected of a
          noblewoman such as herself. She is staunchly loyal to Queen Victoria,
          due to her mother’s influence, and dutifully carries out tasks
          assigned to her with aptitude and acuity. However, her pragmatism
          often manifests to a fault, with her methods possessing a concerning
          apathy for the emotional and physical wellbeing of those involved, as
          well as general moral standards. She has no qualms against lying,
          cheating, seducing, or killing if it accomplishes her goals, and often
          suggests others take courses of action that similarly have no concern
          for moral conventions. She is shown to be serene regardless of the
          situation, maintaining her general apathy even in the face of the
          brutality she often commits towards enemies of the Queen. Despite her
          nigh sociopathy, Suzanna is shown to be somewhat religious, referring
          to the teachings of the Bible, especially the Ten Commandments, to
          guide her actions on the surface, however failing to follow through
          with their meanings when the situation calls for it. Furthermore,
          despite her lack of self-awareness, Suzanna is incredibly perceptive
          when it comes to others, able to gauge what sort of responses and
          actions would elicit the outcome she desires from the people around
          her. She refrains from fighting unless negotiation proves inadequate,
          and dislikes losing competitions, similar to her fiancé, however she
          expresses her frustration in more subtle methods.
        </p>

        <h3>Abilities:</h3>
        <p>
          Suzanna, despite her slender frame, is shown to be a skilled and agile
          combatant with knowledge of a wide range of weapons, and often
          utilizes a mace in-battle. In case of a lack of weapons, she is shown
          to be capable of using her surroundings to her advantage.
        </p>

        <h3>History (Backstory)</h3>
        <p>
          Suzanna was born to Baroness Churchill and her husband, a few years
          prior to her brother. Throughout her early youth, Suzanna would often
          engage in “troublesome behaviors”, and show a general lack of remorse
          for her actions. Baroness Churchill intervened after an incident
          involving her operating on some small animals to observe their
          insides, instilling a deep sense of religion within her to act as a
          guideline for her moral compass. This sense of religion, while waning
          in its intensity, still is followed by Suzanna towards her adult
          years. Suzanna during her youth would also take several courses deemed
          worthy by her mother, all in preparation for her future career as the
          latter’s successor as Lady-of-the-bedchamber in the Queen’s court.
          Thus, amidst her sewing, painting, and general feminine education, she
          was made to assume the disposition of a male, in order to prevent her
          reputation’s decline, and learn how to fence, shoot, and other skills
          typically taught to noblemen. At some point, she was betrothed to her
          fiancé.
        </p>

        <h3>Relationships:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lady Churchill (Mother) - Suzanna has a surprisingly positive
            relationship with her mother, with the latter still caring deeply
            about her despite Suzanna’s eccentricities, which she learned to use
            to her and Suzanna’s advantage. She is one of the reasons for
            Suzanna’s moral apathy, encouraging such action in order to ensure
            the prosperity of the “bigger picture”.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Fiancé- Despite the differences in their respective dispositions,
            Suzanna and her fiancé are alike in many facets and are shown to
            care about each other deeply, despite the flawed ways in which they
            express their affections. He is shown to enjoy her presence, and she
            him, and they allow each other both a challenge and a respite to
            each other. Overall, both share a pride in each other’s
            accomplishments, and are able to find a dynamic that works for the
            both of them.

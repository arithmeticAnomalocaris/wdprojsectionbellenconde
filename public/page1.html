        <h3>Appearance:</h3>
        <p>
          Tsuzuru is a short girl of average height with a pale complexion and
          light blue eyes. She wears her medium-length dark brown hair in a
          loose ponytail, with her bangs swept to the sides of her face. She is
          usually seen wearing a white chihaya atop traditional miko attire,
          however when on leave, she switches this out for a light purple kimono
          with numerous flower patterns, underneath a dark magenta hifu.
        </p>

        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>
          Tsuzuru, when on duty, presents herself as an enigmatic person prone
          to odd, but insightful equivoques that ultimately end up assisting the
          people around her despite their initial perplexions. While she often
          does things for her own amusement, she holds herself back in favor of
          dedicating herself to her duties, and refers to others very formally
          regardless of their age or status. She is also shown to dislike it
          when others look down on her, and is not afraid to coldly reprimand
          others when they speak or act poorly towards her or other people.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, she later reveals herself to be a more carefree individual,
          concerned about the amount of responsibility she is meant to accept in
          her near future, and hopes to make the most of her childhood while she
          still is able to. She is envious of her predecessor Amane, whom she
          believes readily accepted her duties to the Demon Slayer Corps and was
          willing to die for the sake of their goals, and feels guilt for being
          reluctant to do the same. Despite this, she remains cheerful in the
          face of such difficulty and enjoys partaking in eccentric and somewhat
          childish activities and befriending others.
        </p>

        <h3>Abilities:</h3>
        <p>
          Tsuzuru is a skilled marksman, able to shoot using her bow and arrow
          to distances hundreds of meters away with accuracy and precision.

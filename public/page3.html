        <h3>Appearance:</h3>
        <p>
          Kotake is a young girl of average build, with dark hair and eyes. She
          typically wears athleisure or comfortable and modest clothing.
        </p>

        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>
          Kotake is shown to be a well-mannered young girl who remains
          level-headed even during incredibly pressuring situations. Calculating
          and rational, she possesses a natural talent for reading other people
          and possesses an extensive knowledge of many topics, which she often
          uses to her advantage during games. Confident and proud of her
          abilities, Kotake can sometimes be seen as arrogant by other people,
          whom she looks down upon for not being as efficient as her. However,
          due to her somewhat isolated upbringing due to her parents' respective
          careers, she is desperately starved for affection and came to believe
          that the only way she can make others care for her was to stand out in
          every aspect of her life, hence her overachieving nature. She enjoys
          when others praise her abilities, especially her violin-playing, which
          she has devoted almost all of her time towards perfecting. She also is
          shown to enjoy romance novels designed for self-inserts. Despite her
          intelligence, she is still a child, and her immaturity shows when it
          comes to dealing with people, such as not communicating her needs
          effectively and getting upset when others don't understand what she
          wants. She is quite talkative when prompted to speak about her
          interests, contrary to her father's more solemn disposition, and she
          has a suggestive imagination and a somewhat immature sense of humor.
          In the end, she is a kind girl at heart who hopes to help the people
          she cares about succeed in the ways she is familiar with.
        </p>

        <h3>History (Backstory)</h3>
        <p>
          Kotake was born out of wedlock to Mr. Kuzuryu and his girlfriend at
          the time, while the two were still in law school. Due to their
          insufficient means to take care of a child at the time, Kotake was
          left in the care of her grandparents, who spoiled her, and paid for
          her violin instruction. At some point in her life, Kotake found out
          about the circumstances of her birth, leading her to feel the need to
          compensate for her own existence by means of academic and
          extracurricular success. This led to the development of her arrogant
          personality, pushing away friends and acting coldly towards those she
          deems unworthy of her time and effort.
        </p>

        <h3>Relationships:</h3>
        <li>
          Mr. Kuzuryu (father) - Kotake and her father have a distant
          relationship, due to the nature of his work as an international lawyer
          preventing him from spending much time with her. He cares enough about
          her to leave her in the care of her grandparents, and has remembered
          important dates in her life and sent gifts. He has also shown some
          reluctance in testing her in a game, however discards it in favor of
          observing her mental prowess and fortitude for his own studies
          regarding human nature.

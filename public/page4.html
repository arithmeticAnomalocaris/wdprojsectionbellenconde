        Grout Esque (Adoptive Grandfather)

        <br><br>
        
        <h3>Appearance:</h3>
        <p>
          He has an exaggeratedly branch-like crooked nose, and the placement of
          his eyes are obviously asymmetrical (his left eye being obviously
          higher-placed up his face than his right one which falls around his
          cheek-bone area). His posture is uneven, and he looks like a
          hunch-back underneath his long dark coat. His skin colors look like
          block shading and rough coloring. In contrast to everything else about
          his warped-up appearance, his eyes are actually quite normal, and they
          have a light to each pupil, showcasing a form of innocence and
          determination.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>
          Kafka is a humble, but insecure man- not taking pride in his
          appearance, especially with a twin sister so adventurous and charming.
          He is a perfect balance for her however, as he is very imaginative,
          and sensitive. He is both comforted and disturbed by the fact that he
          resembles his grandfather in a few ways both in terms of appearance
          and personality. Unlike Grout however, he definitely doesn’t want to
          be looked down upon by the higher-ups (most prominently Turn Gregor,
          who has emotionally belittled him, and groomed him). He is not as
          confident as the comical Burlesque nor as adored as the gorgeous
          Picturesque, but he finds a way to contribute to this revolt by being
          influential in his literary works under the alias “Huckery”.

        <h3>History (Backstory)</h3>
        <p>
          There is an alien species referred to as ‘Discordians’, split up into
          multiple tribes. These tribes are very hostile and weary of each
          other, typically reacting with violence and lashing anger towards
          another when done so. As time went on however, this hostility seemed
          to gain some formality, and some tribes began to grow tolerant of each
          other, and became allies to gain better odds against their personal
          enemies. His tribe is very down-to-earth, simple, and compared to
          other Discordian tribes, have a long history of avoiding feuds, and
          being underdogs to the society being built. Another thing that adds to
          their more naturally humble nature is the unity they have compared to
          other tribes, as well as their long years of being under the Turn
          tribe as colonies.

        <br> 
        
        <h3>Trivia:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Despite being named “Kafka”, he is actually inspired by the life and
            the artworks of Vincent Van Gogh. <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            - The (prominent) Esque tribe members in the story are all named after
            words that end with the “-esque” suffix, and their personalities are
            based on the definitions respectively.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            - Discordians format their name as “[tribe name] [given name]”.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            - Each of the Esque tribe members’ appearances are based off a random
            object that one may find in their homes- for the example of Kafka,
            he is based off an old photo/painting/book covers, which explains
            his disproportionate appearance which may also be another metaphor
            for “being used” just like an object.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            - He does not struggle at writing any literary form except haikus,
            having even raged over it once before crying for two hours about it.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            - The titles of most of his works (which do not go labelled under his 
            name) contain the word/name "Huckery" to the point that other 
            Discordian tribes have recognized it as a pseudonym.
